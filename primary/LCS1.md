# LCS 1 - LCS Project Rules and Governance

Start Date: 2023-10-21

Contact: LCS Leads <lcs@lcdev.xyz>

Publication Date: 

## §1 Role of the LCS Leads

The LCS Leads shall be in charge of authorizing all LCS Publications. All other authorities are exercised as herein.

## §2 Working Committees

The LCS Project is divided into several working committees responsible for ensuring LCS Publications are suitable for publication and performing other management tasks related to the LCS Project.

Working Committees shall be established by LCS Publications.

Each Working Committee shall establish rules for membership, including the grant and revocation thereof, and other rules of order. Each Working Committee may appoint any officers it may require. Each Working Committee may establish a code of conduct for contribution within the Working Committee, in addition to the LCS Project Code of Conduct established by the Leads.

Working Committees are split into 2 primary categories:
* Technical Working Committees are responsible for reviewing proposed specifications in a domain of expertise on the merits of the specification.
* Procedural Working Committees are responsible for performing procedural tasks relevant to publications, and do not review specifications on their merits.

Each Working Committee shall have a full name, and a 3 letter abbreviation.

## §3 Kinds of Documents

The LCS Project may publish documents in 3 categories:
1. Draft Publications: Proposed Specifications which have not been approved for publication, but are in the process of being drafted into a state suitable for publication. Draft Specifications may be published by the Technical Working Committee it is assigned to once that Working Committee has completed the Initial Acceptance step and its draft number has been assigned.
2. Primary Publications: Specifications which have been approved and published by the LCS Project in a finished capacity. Primary Publications may be published only by the LCS Leads upon completion of all steps of publication.
3. Special Publications: Subordinate Documents to Primary Publications, including minor changes, or extra information relating to the Primary Publication. Special Publications may be published by the Working Committee as authorized by the Primary Publication that the Special Publication Pertains to (See §5)

Each Publication (Draft, Primary, and Special) has a title, which starts with the style of document. Draft Publications shall have style "LCS Draft" followed by the draft number assigned as per §4.

Primary Publications shall have the style "LCS" followed by the publication number assigned as per §4.

Special Publications shall have the style given by the Abbreviation of the Working Committee, followed by `SP`, followed by the special publication number assigned by that working group.

## §4 Steps of Publication

Each Specification shall undergo the following steps prior to being published as a Primary Publication.

1. Assignment and Targeting: A short summary proposal of the specification is transmitted to the Secretariat Working Committee (§6), who assigns the Specification a unique Draft Number, and indicates which Working Committee should be targeted by the Draft. 
2. Initial Acceptance: A copy of the first version of the Draft is transmitted to the Working Committee, who may accept it, reject it, or indicate that the Specification should be retargeted (and may indicate which Working Committee should be targeted). After retargeting, the Draft undergoes Initial Review again. Working Committees should not focus on reviewing the specifics of the Specification during this step, but rather on whether the overall proposed specification has merit.
3. Revision and Review: The Draft is reviewed by the Working Committee for technical details and is modified. It may also be reviewed by other Working Committees as it is appropriate. 
4. Tenative Approval: When the Draft is deemed complete, it is tentatively approved by the Working Committee.
5. Stylistic Review: The Editorial Working Committee (§7.3) reviews the draft according to the current LCS Style Guides, and approves it. Working Committees may require in their rules that drafts be approved by the Editorial Working Committee.
6. Publication Number Assignment: The Secretariat Working Committee Assigns the document a unique Publication Number. A Publication Number remains assigned for 6 months, after which it may be reassigned and the specification must be assigned a new Publication Number. Secretariat Working Committee may extend the assignment time as it deems necessary.
7. Reformatting: The Draft is Reformatted by removing draft-only sections, applying editorial notes, and modifying it to the format for LCS Publications per §7.1. The Reformatted Draft shall then be reviewed and approved by the Editorial Working Committee for the required elements of a publication.
8. Publication: The LCS Leads verify that each step was completed and any other requirements are satisfied, and approve the specification as a Primary Publication. A majority of the LCS Leads must concur to approve publication.

The LCS Leads may permit a Primary Publication to be published notwithstanding this section if special circumstances demand such and provided it is approved by a Unanimous Vote.

## §5 Special Publications

Special Publications are made by Working Committees, which are typically Technical Working Committees. A Working Committee may make Special Publications only where authorized by a Primary Publication, and only pertaining to such a Primary Publication.

Special Publications may make minor changes to a Primary Publication or provide additional information or context to a Primary Publication.

Each Working Committee assigns a number to each of its Special Publications, which is unique.

The process under which a Working Committee may make a Special Publication is set by that Working Committee.

## §6 Secretariat Working Committee and Publication Number Assignment

There shall be a Procedural Working Committee, named the Secretariat Working Committee, which shall be responsible for assigning draft and publication numbers to specifications, and targeting specifications to Technical Working Committees.
